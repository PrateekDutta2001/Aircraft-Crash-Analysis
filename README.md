# Aircraft-Crash-Analysis

Air accident is caused due to pilot error, mechanical error, bad weather, sabotages or human error. these error can be happened any time. air accident is also called flying
mischance. aeronautics misfortunes can happened at any time .flying mischance cases have a Great degree complexity .aircraft crashes cause harm to the population as it may lead to the deaths of people or may even cause Injuries to the people. crash investigation is a major research area and the major techniques used for this investigation are statistics ,grid computing, cloud computing, digital image processing and data mining .with data mining ,we can parse through extremely large amount of data and find out unknown patterns of air mischance. Data mining is defined as a process used to extract usable data from a larger set of any raw data. It is used in the many area, like medicine, environment, education, crime, etc. 

The most common reasons for plane accidents are pilot error, mechanical failure, human error, etc. These parameters are explained as follows: 
1. Pilot Error – Roughly 50% of the aircraft losses incur due to pilot error. There are many chances for The pilots to cause errors from failing to program correctly to miscalculation of the required fuel.

2. Mechanical Failure -Despite developments in model and manufacturing standards of the aircrafts, mechanical failures account for 20% of aircraft losses.

3. Weather - Despite of having multiple electronic aids, aircrafts still struggle to function properly when the weather turns out to be unpleasant like in storms, snow and fog.

4. Sabotage - The dangers posed by sabotage are much less than many people seem to believe. Approximately 10% of aircraft losses occur due to sabotage.

5. Human Error – Mistakes can be made by humans operating when required to work for longer hours. Air traffic controllers, dispatchers, loaders, etc are some of the jobs that are operated by humans.
